# A Look at Global Government Debts
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has open data on general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures, which is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.<sup>1</sup>

As a note, the debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.<sup>1</sup>

## Debt-to-GDP Ratio and Economic Growth
The debt-to-GDP ratio is a reliable indicator of a country’s ability to continue to pay interests back on its debt without refinancing.<sup>2</sup> The lower the debt-to-GDP ratio, the more likely the country is financially stable; alternatively, higher the debt-to-GDP ratio, higher its risk of default becomes.<sup>2</sup> 

The trend of a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is also an indicator of its economic growth. A study by World Bank found that countries with debt-to-GDP ratio greater than 77% for an extended amount of time* experience measurable reduction in economic growth.<sup>3</sup> The graph below shows countries whose debt-to-GDP ratio has been above this threshold for five consecutive years**.

*Due to access issues, even with CMU’s VPN, I was unable to read the full publication to find a numerical value for “extended amount of time”.
**The five consecutive years is for 2014 to 2018 – latest data available for these countries.
