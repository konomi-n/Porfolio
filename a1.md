# A Look at Global Government Debts
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has open data on general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures, which is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.<sup>1</sup>

As a note, the debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable.<sup>1</sup>
