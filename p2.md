# Final Project - Part II: Refine

## Background
In Part I, I mentioned how I originally wanted to tell a story on Universal Basic Income (UBI) but switched to a story on federal minimum wage due to insufficient data. It turned out that one of the on-going experiments on UBI just released their preliminary results few days ago, so I decided to make the switch back. Thus, **this final project will focus on calling for more research on the effects of Universal Basic Income (UBI).**
<br><br><br>

## Wireframes + Storyboard
I decided to integrate both the wireframes and the storyboard into a Shorthand draft, which can be viewed in the following link: [https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ubi/index.html](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ubi/index.html)
<br><br><br>

## User Research Protocol
### I. Target audience
a. Those who are unsure or neutral about Universal Basic Income (UBI).<br>
b. Those who have a positive opinion about UBI but have not necessarily showed support through action. <br>

Those who are opposed to UBI will not be targeted as there is not enough data (open or closed) to counteract their concerns.
<br><br>

### II. Approach to identifying interviewees
Instead of searching those who identified as my target audience, I decided to reach out to those who I considered perspicacious around me. I am not the best at deconstructing the bigger picture into smaller steps (which I felt storytelling is similar to), so I decided to interview those who I consider to be skilled at that. I tried to be mindful of the diversity in the interviewees to get a breadth of perspectives also. The statistics of the 3 interviewees are listed below
* Age: 20s – 40s
* Background: physics, product management, marketing
* Data analysis skills: intermediate to advanced

### III. Interview script
> ##### Introduction
> Hi, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. This is a project for my Telling Stories with Data class which aims to show some kind of data to prompt the audience to take some sort of action. My project focuses on Universal Basic Income or UBI.
> ##### Warm-up (before showing wireframe)
> 1. Do you know what UBI is?
> 2. Do you have a particular opinion about that?
> ##### Main questions (after showing wireframe)
> 1. Did the overall flow make sense?
> 2. Is there any unnecessary information?
> 3. Is there something else you’d like to see?
> ##### Closing
> Do you have anything else you’d like to share with me?
<br>

### IV. Key interview findings
**1. Disconnect in flow of information** <br>
I switched my topic back to UBI at the last minute, which resulted in not having a complete storyline before starting the wireframe. I went through couple of iterations on my own before conducting user research. However, along this process, I had moved, changed, and even omitted some information. This created a disconnect in the flow of information to the participants of the user research who were viewing the story for the first time. Specifically, the explanation/significance of “Key Finding 2” in the draft was not clear to the participants. I had read over quite a few background information on UBI for this project, so the significance was clear to me, but I had failed to explain that to the audience. <br>
**2. Could benefit from control group data** <br>
One of the key visualizations I have in my draft shows what the participants in a UBI experiment spent their money on. A feedback I received was that they wondered what the control group spent their money on, and if comparisons could be made. This data was unavailable in the preliminary reports, but I agree this might have added another angle to the story.<br><br> 
**3. Simple wireframe requires non-distracting images** <br>
I used a default Shorthand template which featured photos of wild animals for my user research wireframe. These images had nothing to do with the story, but I did not remove them as I thought it would make the wireframe a bit more readable than just a black and white page with graphs. However, this turned out to be a mistake as it distracted many of the participants.
<br><br>

### V. Changes to implement
The first key interview finding will result in a simple but a significant fix. I will articulate with words how the data I am showing directly answers a concern of UBI. I agree with one of the comments I received that having comparable data with the control group in the experiment would add more depth to the story; however, those have not yet been published in the preliminary report. The final results of the experiment will probably not be available in time so I may consider finding an external (generic) survey result. The last point in the above key interview findings is something to keep in mind for a future user research interview and will not be a change for the final project.
