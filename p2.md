# Part II: Final Project

## Background
In Part I, I mentioned how I originally wanted to tell a story on Universal Basic Income (UBI) but switched to a story on federal minimum wage due to insufficient data. It turned out that one of the on-going experiments on UBI just released their preliminary results few days ago, so I decided to make the switch back. Thus, **this final project will focus on calling for more research on the effects of Universal Basic Income (UBI).**

## Wireframes + Storyboard
I decided to integrate both the wireframes and the storyboard into a Shorthand draft, which can be viewed in the following link: [https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ubi/index.html](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ubi/index.html)

## User Research Protocol
#### I. Target audience
a. Those who are unsure or neutral about Universal Basic Income (UBI).<br>
b. Those who have a positive opinion about UBI but have not necessarily showed support through action. <br>

Those who are opposed to UBI will not be targeted as there is not enough data (open or closed) to counteract their concerns.
<br>

#### II. Approach to identifying interviewees
Instead of searching those who identified as my target audience, I decided to reach out to those who I considered perspicacious around me. I am not the best at deconstructing the bigger picture into smaller steps (which I felt storytelling is similar to), so I decided to interview those who I consider to be skilled at that. I tried to be mindful of the diversity in the interviewees to get a breadth of perspectives also. The statistics of the 3 interviewees are listed below
* Age: 20s – 40s
* Background: physics, product management, marketing
* Data analysis skills: intermediate to advanced

#### III. Interview script
> ##### Introduction
> Hi, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. This is a project for my Telling Stories with Data class which aims to show some kind of data to prompt the audience to take some sort of action. My project focuses on Universal Basic Income or UBI.
> ##### Warm-up (before showing wireframe)
> 1. Do you know what UBI is?
> 2. Do you have a particular opinion about that?
> ##### Main questions (after showing wireframe)
> 1. Did the overall flow make sense?
> 2. Is there any unnecessary information?
> 3. Is there something else you’d like to see?
> ##### Closing
> Do you have anything else you’d like to share with me?
<br>

#### IV. Key interview findings
* The explanation/significance of ‘key finding 2’ is not as clear. (after verbal explanation, it did, but it seemed out of place us reading through the wireframe)
* What do people not in the UBI program spend their money on?
* Using the animal template (default Shorthand template) was a bit distracting
<br>

#### V. Changes to implement
* Clarify concerns that people have with UBI and clarify how those relate to the key findings I am pointing out (make the connections more obvious)
* Clarify the experiment parameters (who got how much money for how long)
