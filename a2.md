# A Look at Global Government Debts
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has open data on general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures, which is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.<sup>1</sup> The debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and debt is calculated as “the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable”.<sup>1</sup>

The graph below shows an overview of the OECD countries' debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2019 (for those countries with available data).

## Debt-to-GDP Ratio and Economic Growth
The debt-to-GDP ratio is a reliable indicator of a country’s ability to continue to pay interests back on its debt without refinancing.<sup>2</sup> The lower the debt-to-GDP ratio, the more likely the country is financially stable; alternatively, higher the debt-to-GDP ratio, higher its risk of default becomes.<sup>2</sup> 

Examining the changes in a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio can also be useful to analyze as it can be an indicator of its economic growth. A study by World Bank found that countries with debt-to-GDP ratio greater than 77% for an extended amount of time* experience measurable reduction in economic growth.<sup>3</sup> The graph below shows countries whose debt-to-GDP ratio has been above this threshold for five consecutive years.

\_*The full publication was inaccessible, even with CMU’s VPN, to find a numerical value for “extended amount of time”. Thus, the period between 2014 and 2018 was chosen for the graph below (i.e., latest 5 consecutive years of data available)._

## Reflection
I set up the first part of this page in such a way that the use of grid of lines charts would make sense to an audience that is not too familiar with this type of visualization (i.e., past-Konomi before this assignment). I used the words “At a glance” for the graph title to let audiences know that this graph is just an introduction or a big picture overview. I am hoping that this would allow audiences to not feel the need to spend too much time on this graph (unless they want to, because the interactivity of this graph would definitely allow them to if they wished). I also used Excel to preprocess the data by adding full-length country names to make it a bit easier for audiences to compare one country to another. Although I’m not sure if this actually makes it less readable since the amount of text does increase. 

The other visualization I chose was to use a Projection Map to show countries whose debt is slowing their economic growth. I decided to use a map because I thought this would be an easier way for audiences to identify said countries instead of showing a line graph. Although, a simple bar chart might have been the easiest method. There was a fair amount of preprocessing done on Excel: namely, (1) identify countries whose last 5 consecutive data years was above this threshold; (2) categorize them as “At or Above Threshold” and all others as “Under…”; (3) add longitude, latitude values as the template required them. In the end, I was unable to figure out how to shade the whole country instead of these bubbles so that may be a source of confusion. I believe both this projection map and the grid of lines chart are great at getting a quick glance view in different ways. The grid of lines chart is great at quickly seeing the overall trend of each country, and the projection map is great at quickly seeing regions or countries of interest for the specific topic. They are both similar in that they are not quite suited to compare and contrast specific values between countries of interest or see the highest, lowest, middle values quickly – something a bar chart is great at.
