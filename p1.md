# Part I: Final Project
 
## Outline
This project will focus on highlighting the **decline in lifestyle one could afford with a minimum wage job** compared from decades ago to recent years.
1.	Show graph (adjusted for inflation) the change in minimum wage

2.	Original intended purpose of minimum wage (short history) 
3.	Show illustration of a typical lifestyle from decades ago vs now (how that original intended purpose is not being served)

4.	Show figures how many people depend on a minimum wage job (number of affected people)

5.	Call to action: contact your local representative to raise federal minimum now

## Data Source
I originally wanted to tell a story on how there should be more research on the effects of Universal Basic Income. However, because of it is still a nascent initiative, I was unable to find enough open and accessible data that would allow me to tell a story. There are only theoretical predictions by economist and researchers, but no hard data (it’s starting to be collected now by several organizations). Thus, I’ve switched the story to focus on minimum wage as there is abundant data on it. The historical data of minimum wage can be found on several federal websites (e.g., US Department of Labor, Federal Reserve Bank) as well as economic and financial think tanks (e.g., Pew Research Center, Economic Policy Institute). 
1.	[US Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart): History of Federal Minimum Wage Rates Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1938 – 2009
<br> I will use this dataset to show the change in minimum wage. I will need to preprocess the data by adjusting it for inflation before visualizing it.
2.	I have yet to find data on showing the typical lifestyle; however, I presume this wouldn’t be a dataset but more of a combination of secondary research. The CMU library provides access to Statista which has [a report](https://www.statista.com/topics/5920/minimum-wage-in-the-united-states) on US minimum wage so I may use this resource also. 
3.	[Federal Reserve Bank](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T16OC2): Total Wage and Salary Workers Paid at or Below Prevailing Federal Minimum Wage: 16 Years and Over 
<br> This data will be used to show how many people depend on a minimum wage job. I initially was going to just show the data for recent years, but I may combine other data to show the change over the years if it fits in with the narrative.
<br> <br> 
## Method and Medium
1. Preprocessing using Microsoft Excel
<br> From using Flourish in few of the assignments, the preprocessing seemed limited (or maybe I just was not looking in the right places). I am not familiar yet how to preprocess data in Tableau, but if it seems difficult, I may switch to Excel as I am most familiar with their formula.
2.	Visualize using Tableau or Flourish
<br> I will most likely be using Tableau for the visualization as I’ve never used it outside of in-class exercises and would like to become more familiar with it. Another reason is because it seems like a more powerful tool than Flourish. However, if the dataset is simple (as some of the ones I’m planning to use are), I may use Flourish to simplify the task.
3.	Visualize using Photoshop
<br> To illustrate the change in lifestyle from decades ago to now on minimum wage job, I will most likely use visualization that does not involve a chart or a graph. The idea is inspired by Gregg Segal’s _[Daily Bread]( https://powerhousebooks.com/books/daily-bread-what-kids-eat-around-the-world/)_ photographic project where what kids ate in a day is surrounding the child laying on the ground. I won’t be able to photograph such thing for this project, but I may be able to Photoshop this with stock photos. Another option might be to illustrate it using free icons.
4.	Document everything using Shorthand
<br> I’ve never worked with Shorthand before, and it seems like a powerful tool so I will be using that for this story. Aside from the visualizations mentioned above, I will also insert short paragraphs to explain a fuller context. Lastly, the final section will be a call to action to contact the audience’s local representative to raise the federal minimum wage.
