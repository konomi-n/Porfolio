# Critique by Design

### McKinsey Design Index
The consulting firm McKinsey & Company published a report called “The Business Value of Design” which aimed to inform decision makers at companies the value of strengthening their design capabilities. They created the McKinsey Design Index (MDI) and applied that to 173 companies to measure how strong they are at design. Companies that scored in the top quartile for this MDI (i.e., have strong design capabilities) also had higher revenue growth and higher returns to shareholders.

The below graph is an excerpt from that report<sup>1</sup> explaining that correlation.

### Process for Redesign
I started out by sketching two different visualizations to better indicate that these two graphs are not meant to be compared. I started out by showing a pie chart for one and leaving the other as bar chart, but removing the stylizations (e.g., changing the dotted/dashed bars to solid bars). I kept the heading the same as well as the layout (one graph next to the other). I showed this around and many were not quite sure what they were looking at. The title especially seemed to be confusing them. Secondly, the choice of pie chart was confusing people as well. I chose the pie chart to show “higher revenue growth” but I received comments that a pie chart doesn’t quite translate to “growth”. After explaining the context behind it, one pointed out that it seems like the pie chart was chosen just for the sake of it – which made me realized that is true. 

I went back to redesigning and this time decided to change the charts to a slope graph to better highlight the revenue growth. I realized also that this graph type would suit showing the higher returns to shareholders as well. To distinguish these two graphs apart, I put separate headings for each and indicated the point of each graph in their titles. I was torn between choosing different colors for each graph as they are not meant to be compared. However, I realized that each of these are referring to the same group of companies so decided it should be kept as same colors. I decided to remove the axis label as the title should be sufficient. I also decided to keep the scale the same for both chart to keep things consistent and to not mislead the viewers. Below is the completed redesign.
