## Konomi <br>
###### About me
> pronounced _"koh-noh-me"_; she/her/hers <br>
> I am originally from Riverside, CA, now living in Pittsburgh, PA pursuing a degree <br>
> in product development (MIIPS). I enjoy cooking with new ingredients/spices and <br>
> trying cultural dishes from around the world. <br>

###### What I hope to learn
> I have difficultly condensing large amounts of information to succint presentations - <br>
> whether it be visual, written, or verbal. I am hoping this class will help me better <br>
> understand the underlying logic behind that process. I also don't quite have an <br>
> intuitive sense on using color effectively so I am hoping to build that skill also. <br>
> After graduating in December 2021, I hope to work in the field of design strategy.
