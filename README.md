## Konomi
###### About me
> pronounced _"koh-noh-me"_; she/her/hers <br>
> I am originally from Riverside, CA, now living in Pittsburgh, PA pursuing a degree in <br>
> product development (MIIPS). My undergraduate degree is in bioengineering but my <br> 
> longest work experience is in tax accounting - I know, random... I enjoy exploring & <br>
> cooking with new ingredients/spices and trying cultural dishes from around the world. <br>

###### What I hope to learn
> I have difficultly condensing large amounts of information into succint presentations - <br>
> whether visual, written, or verbal. I am hoping this class will help me better understand <br>
> the underlying logic behind that process. I also don't quite have an intuitive sense on <br>
> using color effectively so I am hoping to build that skill also. After graduating in <br>
> December 2021, I hope to work in the field of design strategy.
